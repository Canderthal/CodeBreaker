Code Breaker Game
Welcome to the Code Breaker Game repository! This simple web-based game is the result of my introduction to JavaScript during my time with Nucamp. 
The goal of the game is to crack a 7-digit code arranged from the lowest to the highest digit, with no duplicates allowed. 
Players have a maximum of three attempts to solve the puzzle.
